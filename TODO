BBBS::MRTG ToDo
--------------

lib/BBBS/MRTG.pm
- Add error checking for at least the type variable, which should be 
  either "io" or "user".
- Add option to define the port to use;  if option not defined, then
  default to the standard port, 16425.
- Add code to allow for blank return values, such as when BBBS is not
  running or is blocked from responding.
- Use POD to add documentation to script: Add better note about the
  information it is getting from BBBS.  Also refer to the actual section
  in the BBBS documentation where it is discussed. And just what MRTG is?
- Move example documenation files into a pod file?

README
- Move the BBBS::MRTG operational documentation into the documentation 
  for the module itself.
