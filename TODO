BBBS::MRTG ToDo
--------------

lib/BBBS/MRTG.pm


- Change to instead of printing the data received from the socket like
  the original script did to returning  either an array or a hash with
  the information.

- Change the code that was used to check options passed on the command line to
  options passed in a hash to the read_bbbs_mrtg function.

- Add 'Croak;' to module, so can correct the code using the 'die' to
  'croak' when attempting to open or close a socket.

- Add error checking for at least the type variable, which should be 
  either "io" or "user".

- Add option to define the port to use; if option not defined, then
  default to the standard port, 16425.

- Add code to allow for blank return values, such as when BBBS is not
  running or is blocked from responding.

- Use POD to add documentation to script: Add better note about the
  information it is getting from BBBS. Also refer to the actual section
  in the BBBS documentation where it is discussed. And just what MRTG is?

- Move this ToDo file to lib/BBBS/MRTG/ToDo.pod.

- Move example documenation files into a pod file?


README
- Move the BBBS::MRTG operational documentation into the documentation 
  for the module itself.
