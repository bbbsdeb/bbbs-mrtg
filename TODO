mrtgbbbs ToDo
--------------

- Add an explicit License file, so as to apply it to all files and not
  just in files where it already explicitly noted?

- Add information about installing at least the mrtgbbbs.pl script itself
  into a non standard directory, like for BBBS in /opt/bbbs/scripts?

mrtgbbbs.pl
- Change to using the BBBS::MRTG module for accessing the BBBS MRTG
  port information.
- Add error checking for at least the type variable, which should be 
  either "io" or "user".
- Add option to define the port to use;  if option not defined, then
  default to the standard port, 16425.  Perhaps use an optional 3rd 
  positional parameter?  (First two being required.)
- Put the display of the usage information into a subroutine, so it
  can be used in more than one place in the script.
- Change to using Getopt module for the command line parameters?
- Add debug parameter & debugging code?
- Add code to allow for blank return values, such as when BBBS is not
  running or is blocked from responding.
- Use POD to add documentation to script: Add better note about the
  information it is getting from BBBS.  Also refer to the actual section
  in the BBBS documentation where it is discussed. And just what MRTG is?
- Move example documenation files into a pod file.

README
- Move the mrtgbbbs operational documentation into the documenation 
  in the script itself.

Makefile.PL
- After adding POD to mrtgbbbs.pl script, update Makefile.PL to instead get
  the abstract from there.
- Create a zip archive instead of a tar.gz archive for 'make dist' or have
  two targets;  one for zip & one for tar.gz, and one of those as default.
