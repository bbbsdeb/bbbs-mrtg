Perl script for reading the mrtg info from the BBBS standard port.  
To be run by mrtg (see example script & config info) to update 
mrtg created pages for BBBS related info.

It is hosted at the 'Perl for Fidonet (FTN) Systems' project at SourceForge,
http://ftnpl.sourceforge.net.  The main code repository for it is browsable at 
http://ftnpl.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ftnpl/trunk/scripts/BBBS/mrtgbbbs/.
Archives of it can be found in the Project file downloads section.  They can
also be found on any FTN system that carries the BBBSUTIL File Echo, which is
distributed via the Filegate (www.filegate.net).

Note that the development for this has been done on a Debian Linux
system, running the Linux version of BBBS.  

The parameter to use for bbbsd is "mrtgd:16425", as in the following 
example on my linux system (check your manual for any differences
if you are running a different OS):

/opt/bbbs/bbbsd 1 7 smtpd:1025  mrtgd:16425  "fork" "quiet" "uid:bbbs" &


  An example cron entry for mrtg being run by the user bbbs, which is how
it is run for testing at 1:120/546, is in the file mrtg.cron.

  This an example cron entry for mrtg being run by root, as when it is run as
added to the default mrtg crontab file.
10,40 *	* * * root if [ -x /usr/bin/mrtg ]; then /usr/bin/mrtg /opt/ftn/mrtgbbbs.cfg; fi
