BBBS::MRTG

The traffic statistics for BBBS can be obtained periodically directly from
the BBS, using the capability that BBBS has to provide information usable by
MRTG (Multi Router Traffic Grapher) to display such statistics. The BBBS
documention has a writeup on a python script which can be used to collect
the information from an operational BBBS system; not being content with that,
and knowing that python is not available in as many places as Perl, I created
a Perl version of the script which I named mrtgbbbs.pl. From that, the Perl
Module BBBS::MRTG was created.
