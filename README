Perl scripts for reading the mrtg info from the BBBS standard port.  
To be run by mrtg (see example script & config info) to update 
mrtg created pages for BBBS related info.

Note that the development for this has been done on a Debian Linux v2.2
system, running the Linux version of BBBS.  


The parameter to use for bbbsd is "mrtgd:16425", as in the following 
example on my linux system (check your manual for any differences
if you are running a different OS):

/opt/bbbs/bbbsd 1 7 smtpd:1025  mrtgd:16425  "fork" "quiet" "uid:bbbs" &
