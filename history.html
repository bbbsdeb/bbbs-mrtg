<P>
BBBS is a full featured bbs program that is available for many platforms that includes full Fidonet and Internet support(See the BBBS home page,<A HREF="http://www.bbbs.net">  http://www.bbbs.net </A>for details.) 
</P>

<P>

The version I am useing is the one for Linux/i386.  Originally I had it
installed on a Slackware v3.4 system, but when the new version (v3.42 1s)
came out I needed a Linux distribution that supported the new libc6 (glibc)
libraries.  I choose Red Hat for that, because at the time I had a CD for
that distribution already.   
<P>
Because BBBS supports so much in itself, I decided to find out just how much
of a minimal install of linux was needed to run BBBS.  What I plan to do is
do a minimal linux install, & then install BBBS on it.
Note that this page is a work in progress;  I'm adding to it as I  go.

<P>
BBBS is a full featured bbs program that is available for many platforms that includes full Fidonet and Internet support(See the BBBS home page,<A HREF="http://www.bbbs.net">  http://www.bbbs.net </A>for details.) The version I am useing is the one for Linux/i386.  Originally I had it installed on a Slackware v3.4 system, but when the new version (v3.42 1s) came out I needed a Linux distribution that supported the new libc6 (glibc) libraries.  I choose Red Hat for that, because at the time I had a CD for that distribution already.   
<P>
The problem with Red Hat is that it just doesn't seem possible to do a really minimal install of it;  at least, not easily.  I tried a minimal install of Red Hat (only have about 470 megs total available on the machine I tried it on), & it installed all kinds of things I didn't want or need on the system (including XFree86 librarys).  At the time I decided to move BBBS to it's own box, I had the Red Hat Install sitting at about 160 megs:  could pare it down some more, but it would take time because would have to check any other affected pkgs, to see if I needed to keep them.
<P>
So when I decided to put BBBS on it's own box, I figured I'd use a distribution that supports minimal installs easier.  Thought about using a newer Slackware distribution, but I had heard alot of good things about the Debian distribution so I decided to go with it.

<P>{5/9/99]
The situation was that I was putting together a system based on an old P60;  had just bought a drive for it (WD 1.6 gig), but didn't get another cd rom drive.  Also only had a 5 1/4" floppy drive to use on it.  Did the install using NFS, from another of my systems that does have a CD rom drive;  didn't do the install off of the cd (didn't feel like typeing in those long paths...<g>), just copied the base tgz file (about 10 megs) to  a sub-directory on the system with the cdrom drive (the directory tree is one I already export from the machine) & then did the NFS install off of that...  This base install of Debian v2.1 takes about 32 Megs of drive space.

<P>[5/9/99]
'Course, when they say "base" they mean it...  Basic funtionality, including tcp/ip, is there;  but not much else...  Still need to decide what other pkgs's to install on that system & get them on there...  For use with BBBS, it will not need very much at all...  I will install Perl, but what else will actually be needed I'll be finding out.  More info on that as I do it...  

<P> One thing to note is that the default hosts.allow & hosts.deny files basically disallow things like telneting into the system.  The hosts.allow file needs to be changed, to allow in what you need.  While setting it up, I basically allow anything in from my local lan. 

<P>  24 December 1999 - Finished (I think...) with moving the BBBS install to another
machine, a P90 with 32 Megs of Ram & a 1.6 gig drive.  With that size of a drive, I 
didn't really need to worry as much about how much space the base os install took;  
but I did try to limit it.  I used Debian Linux v2.1, & did the initial install from 
the cdrom's;  then once the system was network capable (very basic install = 53 megs),
I then did updates & any other installs from one of the Debian mirror sites.  Before
I moved BBBS over to it, there was about 83 megs of drive space in use...
